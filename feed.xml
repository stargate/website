After being introduced as open-source software in late 2020, its development has accelerated quickly. I’m here to give you the rundown: the premises on which we built it, the limitations we’ve faced and worked through, and most importantly, the improvements we have made as a community in the past few months. Let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-the-documents-api&quot;&gt;What is the Documents API?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Documents API is a part of &lt;a href=&quot;https://stargate.io/&quot;&gt;Stargate&lt;/a&gt; that enables a user to create, get, modify, delete, and search JSON documents in a collection, all backed by the power and robustness of Apache Cassandra. For the uninitiated, this might seem a little bit like fantasy. An API that facilitates working with JSON documents against a storage database that enforces a schema seems like a bridge between two different worlds, but that is exactly what Stargate is! At its core, the Documents API abstracts away the complexities of converting JSON documents into tabular form and back again, so from a user’s perspective, they only work with JSON over HTTP at any given point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the use-cases that the Documents API is perfect for is rapid iteration. Creating an application quickly, making a bunch of changes, and still being able to store documents in whatever form you desire without any lock-in to a schema is a very potent pattern that is used by agile organizations. Not having to define a schema before storing data is incredibly powerful for this purpose. And because it’s built on Cassandra, there will be pathways in the future to migrate to having a defined schema, when your application has settled on a format for its various data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three main benefits to creating a free-form document API against Cassandra in particular:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Convenience&lt;/strong&gt;: Perhaps you want to start collecting and storing (and searching!) data without knowing precisely what schema it might conform to. Maybe you have such free-form data that you don’t want to require a schema so early in development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;/strong&gt;: Other document stores scale up pretty far, but Cassandra is well-known as the database of greatest scale, being able to theoretically scale infinitely with infinite resources.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durability&lt;/strong&gt;: While other document stores do have this to some degree, Cassandra has a distributed node infrastructure that ensures that data is never lost, and also that downtime is virtually never experienced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to create the Documents API with these three main benefits in mind, we first had to devise a reasonable method of storage of JSON documents. Because the end user does not interact with the Cassandra schema directly, it is up to the API to decide upon and maintain the schema as-is. We decided to do what we describe as “shredding” the JSON document, in order to get it into a form that can easily be stored in Cassandra. This process of shredding can be shown by example; a JSON blob such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nested&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;key1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can be turned into a form where there is one row per &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; in the JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nested&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;key1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;”&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the shredding process, and the data gets stored in a table with a name of the user’s choosing (from their perspective it is called a &lt;strong&gt;collection&lt;/strong&gt;) with a schema as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;key text&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;p0 text&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;p1 text&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;p2 text&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;p3 text&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;…&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;pmax text&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;dbl_value double&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;text_value text&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;bool_value boolean&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;docname&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;a&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;key&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;docname&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;nested&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;key1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;docname&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;[0]&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;docname&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;[1]&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;docname&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;[2]&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Cassandra’s storage format stores rows in a “sparse” format–that is, it only stores the value of non-null columns–this is an efficient way to store document data.  And writing this data is actually quite simple, as all we have to do is iterate through every value in the JSON and determine its path; we then write the document in a single batch to Cassandra. On the flip side, reading a document based on its key (the name of the document) is quite easy as well: just get all of the rows that match the document key, and assemble them back into JSON to return to the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other benefit of this shredding method is that the user can ask for a path within the JSON, such as “what is the value of b.nested?” and it is quite easy to just query for that value and return that relevant row. For those who know Cassandra, note that key is the Partition Key, and p0 through pmax (by default &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;max&lt;/code&gt; is 63) are part of a compound Clustering Key. This is the storage schema that is created on the fly when you create your first document in a new collection. Stargate manages that creation and maintenance of the Cassandra schema so that you don’t have to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;search-filters&quot;&gt;Search filters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different search functions that are available with the documents API. You can search within the document for all of the paths that match a predicate, which is perfect for larger documents, and you can search for documents that match a predicate in an entire collection. Both of these search functions allow a set of filters, which are used by sending JSON as a query parameter. The allowed filters are: $eq, $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte, $exists, $ne, $in, and $nin. If multiple filters are supplied, they are executed using AND, since OR is not yet supported natively by CQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of subtlety with these filters, however. Some filters ($eq, $gt(e), $lt(e), $exists) translate directly into CQL and therefore can do their filtering in Cassandra, which is fast and efficient on the whole, but the rest ($ne, $in, and $nin) are not natively supported by Cassandra. In order to bridge this gap, we deemed these filters “limited-support” filters, and gave them the following restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data will be fetched from Cassandra &lt;em&gt;unfiltered&lt;/em&gt; in pages, and as those pages come out the relevant limited-support filters will be applied &lt;em&gt;in-memory&lt;/em&gt; on the coordinator node (where Stargate runs).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For a search within a document, the result set must fit within a single Cassandra page. This essentially means that the page-size you request with has to be sufficiently low.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result of the above, it is expected that limited-support filters perform poorly for cases where either you are searching for a small set of results within a large document, or if you are searching for a small number of documents in a large collection. Also, if you are using multiple filters (regardless of whether they are limited-support), you will observe a similar performance pattern as of version 1.0.16.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataStax has published a Cassandra Enhancement Proposal to bring its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datastax.com/blog/eliminate-trade-offs-between-database-ease-use-and-massive-scale-sai-storage-attached&quot;&gt;Storage-Attached Indexing technology&lt;/a&gt; to Cassandra, which will allow more efficient native indexing of this type of filter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;improvements-past-and-planned&quot;&gt;Improvements, past and planned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Documents API was in beta in late 2020 and had its first major version released at the end of 2020. As such, there was and still is a lot to improve upon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very first issue that was seen after release was an issue of performance. Initial benchmarks showed that against a Cassandra cluster with 2 Stargate nodes and 2 Storage nodes the average latency for reads (under high concurrency) was 40 milliseconds. While not terrible, a great deal of JVM profiling was done to determine where exactly the time was being spent. It was determined that the authentication process was the culprit, as it attempts to read from (and in some cases write to) an internal table each time the user authenticates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By keeping this data in a short-lived cache, we could avoid the performance penalty associated with auth. The next thing we noticed was that our endpoints were not utilizing asynchronous execution in quite the manner we wanted. By adding async at the highest level of the HTTP service, we were able to get some performance gains on both read and write. After these two major changes, we began to see average read latencies of between 12 and 18 milliseconds, depending on the version of Cassandra that was being used. Not only that, these changes affected the write path as well, so this change of between 2x-3x was observed for creating and updating documents as well. Not a bad first stab, and there is still more to come!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another optimization that was made since release was to the “search across collections” functionality. In earlier versions, if you searched across a collection with any filters, you would end up filtering in memory, in the inefficient manner described above. This meant that if you had a table with a million documents that had 10 fields each, a simple $eq filter that matched only a few results would take &lt;em&gt;minutes&lt;/em&gt; to complete, or time out entirely. A change was made in v1.0.13 that improved the performance in this particular case by querying Cassandra; now that same process takes on the scale of 100 milliseconds. There is still more room for optimization there, which is very promising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the future, we are looking into ways to support OR queries, and also ways to use Cassandra for more of these multi-filter AND queries, which would likely improve performance by a ton. As this progresses, we will be benchmark testing at every step to see what kinds of performance improvements we are getting. All in all, I’m very excited to see what future the Document API holds—there is a lot of potential room for improvement, and we are just getting started!&lt;/p&gt;

This means that you can now use REST, GraphQL, and schemaless Document APIs in addition to CQL when building your applications on top of DSE. These APIs are available for use with DSE 6.8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-stargate&quot;&gt;What’s Stargate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stargate is an open source data gateway with built-in extensibility. It allows you to integrate APIs of your choice with any persistence layer. It provides this ability with two components: API services and persistence services. What this means is you can create APIs to connect with various persistence stores, such as DSE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stargate-with-dse&quot;&gt;Stargate with DSE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this release, Stargate supports DSE 6.8 as one of these pluggable persistence stores. In order to run Stargate, users will need to add additional nodes to their cluster. These nodes will behave as coordinators in the cluster and no data will be stored on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/turbocharge-app-development-on-dse-with-stargate-support-for-modern-data-apis/stargate-dse-integration-example.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-enterprises-need-stargate&quot;&gt;Why Do Enterprises Need Stargate?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern developers need schemaless data.&lt;/strong&gt; Building an app and then continuing to iterate is a critical part of accelerating time to market. For too long, developers and DBAs have had to predefine the schema before writing their first line of code. Adding a new field (for a phone number, for example), required an ‘ALTER TABLE’ command, costing even more time. With Stargat`e, Document-based development can use schemaless JSON without the need for defining and modifying schemas during the development life cycle. Your application can now evolve as fast as your customers’ needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern apps need modern data APIs.&lt;/strong&gt; Exchanging data with simple, easy-to-use APIs is a fundamental characteristic of modern data apps. Gone are the days of custom or vendor-specific APIs, many of which don’t work with popular new languages and frameworks such as Java, Python, React, and Spring. GraphQL API usage has doubled annually for the last 5 years (&lt;a href=&quot;https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/datalayer/&quot;&gt;50%&lt;/a&gt; of developers say they are or will be using GraphQL). And REST is still the gold standard as &lt;a href=&quot;https://rapidapi.com/blog/rapidapi-developer-survey-insights/&quot;&gt;63%&lt;/a&gt; of all APIs are using REST. Stargate is aligned with building modern apps; it provides REST, Document (JSON) and GraphQL APIs to help developers create applications using the languages and frameworks they know best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern architecture needs microservices.&lt;/strong&gt; Cloud-native applications are predominantly built using a microservices architecture and run via Kubernetes. Stargate was designed with this in mind. It abstracts away backends, enabling developers and architects to focus on interacting with data using modern APIs, and not on specific database implementations. Developers have the freedom to use what languages they know and what fits their requirements to build microservices. These are necessary elements for reducing the friction to build innovative cloud native applications. And by leveraging Kubernetes, Stargate mitigates some of the hurdles associated with a microservices architecture like scalability and resiliency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“At Yelp, we are excited about Stargate’s vision to be an open-source and cloud-native data access API gateway. We already heavily rely on the reliability and resilience of Cassandra to handle big workloads with zero downtime. Therefore, the ability to abstract Cassandra-specific concepts entirely from app developers and support different API options — like REST, GraphQL and gRPC — will go a long way in removing barriers of entry for new software developers at Yelp.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;“Our team is focused on implementing technology that empowers our customers to innovate and invest for a better future. Currently, it is hard to lift and shift our older driver versions in our data infrastructure. Using Stargate’s REST API platform would simplify this and allow us to build modern apps with ease. We are excited to see how we can modernize our architecture with Stargate in Astra.”&lt;/p&gt;

If you’d like to learn more and see how Stargate exposes these endpoints and integrates with DSE, take a look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://stargate.io/2020/09/14/init-stargate.html&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate&quot;&gt;Stargate&lt;/a&gt; source code for a deeper dive. The blog post does a great job of explaining the mechanics of Stargate and you can always dig into the code for a more thorough analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get started today! &lt;a href=&quot;https://downloads.datastax.com/#stargate&quot;&gt;Download Stargate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datastax.com/resources/webinar/create-new-apps-faster-worlds-most-proven-nosql-database-nam&quot;&gt;sign up for our upcoming webinar&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s a monumental day for DataStax Enterprise (DSE) users: Stargate support for DSE is here!

&lt;p&gt;We have tons of APIs integrated within great tools for building dynamic, full stack apps. If you are a developer, you probably are using technologies like schemaless data stores, serverless architectures, JSON APIs, and/or the GraphQL language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, there are a bunch of cool frameworks like the &lt;strong&gt;Jam&lt;/strong&gt;stack (&lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;avaScript, &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;PIs, and &lt;strong&gt;M&lt;/strong&gt;arkup) and services like Netlify to make it fast to deploy a serverless app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, for the first time ever, Apache Cassandra is a part of this stack because &lt;a href=&quot;https://astra.datastax.com/&quot;&gt;Stargate is now live on Astra&lt;/a&gt; as the official data API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern apps we build need data APIs which integrate into our toolset and work with native data shapes (JSON, REST, GraphQL, etc). These data APIs need to support schemaless JSON, while simultaneously providing speed and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, it better only take a few minutes for us to use them within our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataStax built &lt;a href=&quot;https://stargate.io/&quot;&gt;Stargate&lt;/a&gt; into Astra to give us, app developers, a natural data API stack which meshes with the Jamstack (or serverless stack of your choice). Stargate in Astra is built on the rock solid NoSQL data engine (Apache Cassandra) which powers Netflix, Instagram, Yelp, iCloud and other apps we all use everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-exactly-is-stargate&quot;&gt;What exactly is Stargate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stargate is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://stargate.io/2020/09/14/init-stargate.html&quot;&gt;open source data gateway&lt;/a&gt; that sits between your app server and your databases. Stargate brings together an API platform and data request coordination code into one OSS project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple successful app companies - like Netflix and Yelp - built their own data gateways to help internal app developers create features using simple APIs, without needing to learn the underlying database or mess with schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DataStax integrated Stargate into Astra to give you the same power and ease of access to your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No upfront data modelling needed for Documents.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less custom code to maintain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More time to build what you care about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stargate-astra/stargate-astra.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can work with your data the way you want – JSON via schemaless document APIs or database schema aware GraphQL and RESTful APIs – while Stargate serves as the proxy that coordinates these requests to different flavors of Cassandra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see it in action, let’s see how this works by using JSON with Stargate’s schemaless Document API in a TikTok clone. Because, if Instagram and Snapchat have a TikTok clone, we should have one, too. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;real-quick-note-first&quot;&gt;Real Quick Note First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slinging JSON to and from Apache Cassandra without data modeling is just too much fun. You gotta &lt;a href=&quot;http://astra.datastax.com/&quot;&gt;try this out in Astra for yourself&lt;/a&gt;. You can get &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datastax.com/dev/documents-api&quot;&gt;hands on with it right away&lt;/a&gt; or check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://astra.datastax.com/sample-app-gallery&quot;&gt;sample app gallery&lt;/a&gt; to see schemaless Cassandra in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are stoked to have engineers from Netflix, Burberry, Macquarie Bank, USAA, and Yelp creating Stargate with us. They are already hard at work battletesting the APIs and collaborating on new features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, onto the code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;posts-in-tiktok&quot;&gt;Posts in TikTok&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are going to walk through using Stargate’s APIs in Astra for creating and updating posts within a TikTok clone. We’re walking through examples that are ready to be pasted into your latest Jamstack app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Stargate in Astra in your app, first install and set up our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrajs/collections&quot;&gt;JavaScript SDK&lt;/a&gt;. You can learn about storing environment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSmzEGZQI5A&quot;&gt;variables in your .env file here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a basic TikTok post: a video with a caption, like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;postData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;postId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;https://i.imgur.com/FTBP02Y.mp4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;caption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;These ducks are cute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;timestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;2020-12-09T09:08:31.020Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;likes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After connecting to Stargate in Astra with a nodejs client, let’s create a new collection in our app and add the post with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;postsCollection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;astraClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;tikTokClone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;postsCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;postData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever used Cassandra before, you know this is amazing. Look at what we didn’t do: no data modeling, no table creation, no configuration code, no partition keys, no clustering columns. I think you get my drift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stargate in Astra allows you to add data to Apache Cassandra in one line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This level of ease of use hasn’t previously been possible with Cassandra. Insert JSON and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, let’s say you want to find all posts about ducks. You can do that via:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// find all posts about ducks&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;postsCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;caption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;$in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;ducks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And boom. Now you have your ducks channel all set up for your users. Because who doesn’t want a stream fully dedicated to ducks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, your app isn’t going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/twitter-fleets-reactions-memes-edit-button-1548037&quot;&gt;be like Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. We can edit stuff here. Let’s show how to edit your post’s caption. Stories tho? That’s on you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// update the post’s caption&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;postsCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;documentId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;caption&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;These ducks are MEGA cute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above was just a quick tour on how to do a few data API calls for a basic TikTok clone. Want to see the full thing?

&lt;p&gt;We would love to see how you customize your TikTok clone to show off more ways to feature data in your app. Or, you can create your own non-TikTok example. We would love to showcase your example in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://astra.datastax.com/sample-app-gallery&quot;&gt;sample app gallery&lt;/a&gt;, so tell us about it in &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/33mKDHHFUE&quot;&gt;our contribute channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-you-are-down-here-looking-for-a-few-more-details&quot;&gt;So, you are down here looking for a few more details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you came down here, maybe you are looking for a few more lines of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s show how to set up the node JS client and a few more data API calls. For starters, let’s take a look at how to set up your client to connect to Stargate in Astra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// npm install @astrajs/collections&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;@astrajs/collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// create an Astra client&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;astraClient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;astraDatabaseId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ASTRA_DB_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;astraDatabaseRegion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ASTRA_DB_REGION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ASTRA_DB_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ASTRA_DB_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, let’s create a users collection in our database to store documents about our TikTok users:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// create the users collection in the app&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;usersCollection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;astraClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;tikTokClone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;collection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A TikTok user in our app will have the basics: a unique id, a name, username, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;userData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;id_3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Mo Farooq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;mofarooq32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;avatar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;https://i.imgur.com/9KYq7VG.png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s add our user into our collection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// create a new user&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;usersCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;userData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check to make sure your user was stored in the database by reading the user back by any of their properties, like their username.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// find our user by username&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;users&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;usersCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;$eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;mofarooq32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can lookup a user by their &lt;strong&gt;documentId&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// get the user by document id&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;usersCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;documentId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, lastly, if you need to delete that user:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// delete the user&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;usersCollection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;documentId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Maybe you’re using Node.js or Python or any other dynamic language that uses JSON-like data natively or maybe you’re working with data that you’re pulling or serving from REST APIs. Either way, increasingly it seems like everything is ending up in JSON at some point.  Most of the time, this isn’t a problem, it’s just the way that we build software these days.  There’s just one problem, and that’s that Cassandra isn’t particularly good at JSON…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To double-click on that, the problem isn’t the JSON data format itself, although Cassandra doesn’t make JSON easy, it’s the way most devs use JSON when we’re building our apps.  Iterative development means that plans change.  The user registration form now needs a couple of more fields and the front-end dev went ahead and added them.  That API I’m calling returns some extra data.   Welcome to the loosely coupled world, it’s all fun and games until my app needs to send it to the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early days, Cassandra actually made this pretty simple to do, but as the project matured and added features like enterprise-friendly SQL-like query languages and better indexing, that meant that we needed the database to enforce a schema.  Over time, it became harder and harder to use Cassandra for things like JSON and other document-oriented use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Stargate - if there’s one thing you should know about the Stargate team it’s that our personal mission is to make Cassandra easy for every developer.  Figuring out how to give Javascript devs native JSON support without having to give up any of the reliability and scalability goodness of Cassandra was a challenge we couldn’t pass up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea gave rise to the Stargate &lt;strong&gt;Documents API&lt;/strong&gt;, which lets most Cassandra distros (Cassandra 3.11, Cassandra 4.0, and DataStax Enterprise 6.8), work with JSON through a REST API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;api-features-and-design&quot;&gt;API features and design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tjake&quot;&gt;Jake Luciani&lt;/a&gt; and I started to create the bones of this API, we realized that Cassandra is nothing like a document store. Expressing data as rows is straightforward, but expressing trees of JSON data is really not. In addition, mapping that JSON data onto a table managed by Stargate and keeping both writes and reads reasonably fast adds an additional layer of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, we mapped out three main design components in order for this work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modeling Documents in Cassandra&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handling Reads and Writes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Figuring out Deletes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of this blog walks through how we approached each design and resolved some hiccups along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modeling-documents-in-cassandra-with-document-shredding&quot;&gt;Modeling Documents in Cassandra with Document Shredding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that we had to decide  was the schema of the managed table that backs a document collection. Due to some great discussions with some Cassandra specialists, it was decided that when a user creates a document, a table will be created with a statement of the form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bool_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;txt_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dbl_value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;double&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;leaf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point is where we had to solve an unbounded data modeling problem. Because any JSON document that has a depth of [N] or less can be added to this table, each value in the JSON will get stored as a row in the table. So if I wanted to represent a document called “x” that has the JSON:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The document would be “shredded” into rows looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;p0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;p1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;dbl_value&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;x&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;a&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;x&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;null&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For data with an array, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;b&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;c&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there would be two rows, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;key&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;p0&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;p1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;p2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;dbl_value&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;x&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;a&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;b&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;null&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;x&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;c&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;[0]&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;d&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Array elements are stored with square braces in the column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;handling-reads-and-writes&quot;&gt;Handling Reads and Writes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next problem that arose was that naïvely, updates to a document could require reading the document from the database, seeing what modification would have to be made, and then writing the updated data.  This “read-before-write” process is a notorious source of performance and consistency issues in most data stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we resolved to avoid doing any read-before-write operations at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting implementation detail that came up is that when you write some data to a document, the resulting write operation is just a simple batch with some inserts and deletes. In some cases, this can cause the document rows in the database to show two different states for the same JSON field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And, upon reading the rows out, the Documents API reconciles conflicting information by accepting the data that has a later Cassandra write time (much like Cassandra itself!).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This allows us to write data really quickly while not compromising too much in reads either, as the reconciliation does not happen often and is also quite fast. It also gives us a very important core principle to our basic write and read operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every write to a single document is a single batch of statements, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Every read from a single document is a single SELECT statement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So writes and reads are squared away - but what about deletes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;figuring-out-deletes&quot;&gt;Figuring out Deletes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the distributed nature of the database, a deletion in Cassandra actually is very similar to an insert, but instead a “tombstone” is written at a particular write time to signify the death of a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rest in peace… almost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cassandra periodically (the frequency here depends on your compaction strategy and/or cluster load) does a compaction operation to remove tombstones and alleviate this pressure, so the only way to avoid overwhelming Cassandra is to make sure that the frequency of deletions is low enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poses a problem for the Document API specifically because of arrays. Let’s walk through this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you have an array at some key that is of length 100000. If you then issue a replace operation (via a PUT) and decide to replace that array with some other value, then all of those 100000 rows would be deleted, causing 100000 tombstones to be written.  This is an enormous number of tombstones to be written in one operation, and if you do that just a few more times, Cassandra will likely get super slow. So the structure of the data in each table needed one last major modification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We said before that array paths are stored in the database with square brackets; for example the element at index 0 would be stored as [0]. That would mean a deletion of 100000 elements would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;DELETE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[0]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[1]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[2]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[99999]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Causing 100000 tombstones to be written. Instead of doing that, we decided to pad all array elements with leading zeros, so the element at index 0 would instead be represented as [000000], and the element at index 99999 would be [099999]. Doing this allowed us to change the deletion statement to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;DELETE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[000000]'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;p0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'[999999]'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which causes only a single so-called “range” tombstone to be written, instead of 100000 cell tombstones (note that greater and less than works on strings in Cassandra and will compare lexically). It also relaxes the array length limit to one million elements, which is pretty neat! The time series below shows how the old vs. new implementation might behave, if you performed compactions every week:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/tombstone_counts.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the new strategy is just safer for deletions; it would require an incredibly large amount of deletion with the new strategy to even come close to the theoretical tombstone limits!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preliminary-look-at-api-performance&quot;&gt;Preliminary Look at API performance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;⚠️ Before starting on this section, we want to mention that benchmarking is a great tool, but does not necessarily represent how a system will behave under real load, out in the wild. We also haven’t done comparisons on the same hardware with other document stores…yet. Alright, let’s get to it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to test that the Document API is reasonably fast, we ran a benchmark test using a single Cassandra storage node and a single Stargate node (Stargate is the API that contains the Documents API). We then ran two different benchmarks, one that uses HTTP GET to repeatedly get random paths in a document, and another that performs HTTP POSTs repeatedly to create brand new documents.  Each of these actions got run 100000 times, and here are two graphs of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep things simple, as there is no baseline to compare things against just yet, the benchmark was performed using only one requester at a time, with light concurrency (10 users at once), and with more concurrency (100 users at once). Note that it’s expected with only one backend node that higher concurrency would cause degradation in performance; you should have multiple nodes to service that degree of concurrent requests!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the results for reads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;simple-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1 user:&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10 users:&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;100 users:&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_1_User.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_10_Users.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Reads_100_Users.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;simple-table&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;1 user:&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;10 users:&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;100 users:&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_1_User.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_10_Users.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/the-stargate-cassandra-documents-api/Writes_100_Users.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the above, we can see that the API performs pretty well at a reasonable level of concurrency for our setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APIs in Stargate are being actively developed, so we are hoping to be able to get back to you soon with news of even more improvements!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="json" /><category term="api" /><category term="documentation" /><category term="stargate" /><summary type="html">If you’re like me, when you start coding something new, you’re probably finding yourself working with JSON. Maybe you’re using Node.js or Python or any other dynamic language that uses JSON-like data natively or maybe you’re working with data that you’re pulling or serving from REST APIs. Either way, increasingly it seems like everything is ending up in JSON at some point. Most of the time, this isn’t a problem, it’s just the way that we build software these days. There’s just one problem, and that’s that Cassandra isn’t particularly good at JSON…</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://stargate.io/assets/images/default-stargate.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://stargate.io/assets/images/default-stargate.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello GraphQL; meet Cassandra</title><link href="https://stargate.io/2020/10/05/hello-graphql.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello GraphQL; meet Cassandra" /><published>2020-10-05T06:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-10-05T06:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://stargate.io/2020/10/05/hello-graphql</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://stargate.io/2020/10/05/hello-graphql.html">&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re happy to introduce a new member of the Stargate API family; say hello 👋 to GraphQL. This new API extension makes it easy to add a GraphQL API layer to any new or existing Apache Cassandra® database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you already know Cassandra and its data model, this first version of the GraphQL API in Stargate is for you. If you’re completely new to Cassandra and its query language (CQL), feel free to follow along, but you’re either going to need to brush up on the basics of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.datastax.com/dev&quot;&gt;Cassandra&lt;/a&gt; or wait until the upcoming releases that will give you the option of skipping CQL completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Stargate’s GraphQL API is added to an existing Cassandra deployment, it scans the database and automatically creates HTTP endpoints with GraphQL queries and mutations for the objects that it finds in the database. New database tables can also be created directly via the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re just getting started with this new extension and we’d love to hear what you think. Read on to see the steps to get started and drop a comment on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Agraphql&quot;&gt;GitHub issues&lt;/a&gt; labeled with “graphql”, shoot us a thread on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stargate.io/g/stargate-users&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;, or give us a shout on Twitter at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stargateio&quot;&gt;@stargateio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class=&quot;code-row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;code-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;SELECT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;FROM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Dune'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;code-column&quot;&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-graphql&quot; data-lang=&quot;graphql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;eq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Dune&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}){&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;author&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;genre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stargate’s GraphQL API is built using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.graphql-java.com/&quot;&gt;GraphQL Java&lt;/a&gt; implementation and you can find the source code in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate/tree/master/graphqlapi&quot;&gt;graphqlapi directory&lt;/a&gt; in the Stargate repo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, the API exposes two HTTP endpoints. The first is at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/graphql-schema&lt;/code&gt; path and exposes an API for exploring, creating and altering the database schema. The second is at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/graphql/{keyspace-name}&lt;/code&gt; path and exposes an API for inserting, modifying, deleting and querying data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the mutations at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/graphql-schema&lt;/code&gt; path are built using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GraphQLFieldDefinition&lt;/code&gt; API from GraphQL Java and the generated fields mirror the Data Definition Language in Cassandra. Let’s look at an example of the createTable mutation below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-sql&quot; data-lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;createTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keyspaceName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;partitionKeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ColumnInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;clusteringKeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ClusteringKeyInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ColumnInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ifNotExists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll see that this has the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;keyspaceName&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tableName&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;partitionKeys&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clusteringKeys&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;values&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ifNotExists&lt;/code&gt; fields. In the Stargate code, this is defined with the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLFieldDefinition&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;buildCreateTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLFieldDefinition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newFieldDefinition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;createTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;keyspaceName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nonNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Scalars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;tableName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nonNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Scalars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;partitionKeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nonNull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;buildColumnInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()))))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;clusteringKeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;buildClusteringKeyInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;buildColumnInput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;argument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newArgument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;ifNotExists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Scalars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLBoolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Scalars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLBoolean&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dataFetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;schemaDataFetcherFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createSchemaFetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;CreateTableDataFetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is the use of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DataFetchers&lt;/code&gt; which is what provides the data for the field. This is where the translation between the GraphQL input to the Cassandra query happens. You’ll see for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;createTable&lt;/code&gt; mutation that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CreateTableDataFetcher&lt;/code&gt; takes the arguments from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DataFetchingEnvironment&lt;/code&gt;, translates that to a Cassandra query, and passes it to the persistence engine for processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the mutations and queries for Stargate’s GraphQL API follow this general pattern. If you’re interested in more of this nitty gritty, hop down to the Deep Dive section of this blog or better yet check out the source code in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate/tree/master/graphqlapi&quot;&gt;graphqlapi&lt;/a&gt; directory!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;Get started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get your hands on the GraphQL API is to use the Stargate docker image and start the container in developer mode. There is also a built-in GraphQL Playground servlet to make it easy to test and tinker with your mutations and queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set-up-get-the-image-and-authenticate-then-hello-graphql&quot;&gt;Set-Up: Get the image and authenticate. Then, hello GraphQL.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Pull down and fire up the latest docker image&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/u/stargateio&quot;&gt;https://hub.docker.com/u/stargateio&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;docker pull stargateio/stargate-3_11:v0.0.6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With DEVELOPER_MODE=true, start the container: (This removes the need to install a separate Cassandra instance.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;docker run &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; stargate &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 8081:8081 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 8080:8080 &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;CLUSTER_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;stargate &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;CLUSTER_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;3.11 &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DEVELOPER_MODE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ENABLE_AUTH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; stargateio/stargate-3_11:v0.0.6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Generate an authentication token&lt;/strong&gt; from Stargate’s REST-based auth service using the default credentials. Note: these credentials should be changed for real environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-L&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-X&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://localhost:8081/v1/auth'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-H&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--data-raw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'{
    &quot;username&quot;: &quot;cassandra&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;: &quot;cassandra&quot;
}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should see this output, copy the token to your clipboard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;authToken&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;{auth-token-here}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Insert your creds into your GraphQL Playground&lt;/strong&gt;
Access the GraphQL Playground in a browser:
&lt;a href=&quot;localhost:8080/playground&quot;&gt;localhost:8080/playground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paste your auth token as a header parameter in the HTTP HEADERS pop-up in the lower left hand corner of GraphQL Playground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your token needs to be in the following format in the header window:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;X-Cassandra-Token&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;{auth-token-here}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hello-graphql/step3_insert_creds.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is it! You are ready to make tables, insert, and read data. Let’s do that next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;graphql--cassandra-making-tables-and-data-io&quot;&gt;GraphQL + Cassandra: Making Tables and Data I/O&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Explore the schema API&lt;/strong&gt; by entering &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8080/graphql-schema&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8080/graphql-schema&lt;/a&gt; into the playground’s URL field. An example is below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hello-graphql/step1_explore_schema.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click on the DOCS and SCHEMA tabs on the right hand side of your screen to see the GraphQL types, mutations, and queries generated by Stargate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Create a keyspace&lt;/strong&gt; by running the mutation below in GraphQL Playground&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-graphql&quot; data-lang=&quot;graphql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mutation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;createKeyspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;library&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;replicas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/hello-graphql/step_2_create_keyspace.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Create tables&lt;/strong&gt; by running the mutation below in GraphQL Playground&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-graphql&quot; data-lang=&quot;graphql&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mutation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;createTable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keyspaceName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;library&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;books&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;partitionKeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;title&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;basic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TEXT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like that you have a GraphQL API on top of your Cassandra database. You can find the full reference for this API and more in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stargate.io/docs&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deep-dive&quot;&gt;Deep Dive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s peel back the layers a bit further and talk about a few other aspects of the API. One question that you may ask, what happens when the schema changes? To ensure that Stargate’s GraphQL API stays in sync with the database objects, there are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EventListeners&lt;/code&gt; that detect the changes and update the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;KeyspaceHandlers&lt;/code&gt; accordingly. This means that if you add/remove tables or change the types of columns, the Stargate GraphQL API will reflect those changes automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mutations and queries available at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/graphql/{keyspace-name}&lt;/code&gt; path work similarly to those at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/graphql-schema&lt;/code&gt; path. The available mutations for a single table are insert, update, and delete and correspond to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;INSERT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; statements that are available in Cassandra. Each table also has a generated query that allows you to read rows with filtering on the primary key and ordering based on the clustering key. An example of the insert mutation from Stargate’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate/blob/master/graphqlapi/src/main/java/io/stargate/graphql/core/GqlKeyspaceSchema.java&quot;&gt;GqlKeyspaceSchema&lt;/a&gt; class is below.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dataFetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fetcherFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;InsertMutationDataFetcher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Queries have a filter option available that is defined by a custom &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GraphQLInputObjectType&lt;/code&gt;. This filter is useful when you only want to pull back data that fits certain criteria. The filters available in this first release are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;eq&lt;/code&gt; (equal), &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;notEq&lt;/code&gt; (not equal), &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gt&lt;/code&gt; (greater than), &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gte&lt;/code&gt; (greater than or equal to), &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lt&lt;/code&gt; (less than), &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lte&lt;/code&gt; (less than or equal to), and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; (within) operators. Note that these can only be used with fields that were in the primary key during table creation, just like in Cassandra. In the Stargate code that is defined with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLInputObjectType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filterInputType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLScalarType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;GraphQLInputObjectType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newInputObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stargate’s GraphQL API also allows you to have control over the execution of the request with Cassandra. You can set the consistency level for a query to dictate how many data replicas must respond and also the row limit, pagesize and pagestate. All of the normal Cassandra data types are supported with the exception of User Defined Types, Sets, Maps, Tuples and Lists (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate/issues/141&quot;&gt;#141&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate/issues/126&quot;&gt;#126&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned as we continue to iterate on this new GraphQL API and you can follow along by checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate/issues&quot;&gt;GitHub issues&lt;/a&gt; that are labeled with “graphql”. If there’s anything missing that you think needs to be included, give a 👍 on the corresponding GitHub issue or file a new one if we haven’t captured it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always we hope that you’ll join us on this collective journey and feel free to give us a shout on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, the stargate-users &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stargate.io/g/stargate-users&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;, or on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stargateio&quot;&gt;@stargateio&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll see you in the stars!&lt;/p&gt;

This project came about because we got tired of using different databases and different APIs depending on the work that we were trying to get done. With “read the manual” fatigue and lengthy selection processes wearing on us every time we created a new project, we thought - why not create a framework that can serve many APIs for a range of workloads? From this, Stargate was born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you’re a JavaScript developer building a website, saving and searching JSON is great and maybe you also have some GraphQL sprinkled throughout. If you’re a Java or C# developer working on an enterprise application, SQL is likely more your style. The goal of Stargate is to make your data available for you through whatever API you can dream up regardless of the backing datastore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve started with Apache Cassandra as the first backend and implemented the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) and a REST API for CRUD access to data in tables and have many more APIs coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any project to thrive it needs to be easy to work with and contribute to. We kept that in mind while architecting Stargate and the core codebase is modularized to facilitate extensibility and collaboration. We hope that you’ll join us on this journey to redefine what’s possible when it comes to interacting with data at scale and if you’re interested in getting involved you can check out the code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, join our &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stargate.io/g/stargate-users&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;, or follow us on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stargateio&quot;&gt;@stargateio&lt;/a&gt;! 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/init-stargate/stargate.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-stargate-work&quot;&gt;How does Stargate work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stargate is a data gateway component that is deployed between your client applications and database. We chose Cassandra as the first database because it solves the world’s hardest scale and availability challenges and we think there’s low hanging fruit in terms of APIs for the database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stargate itself is based on the concept of a Cassandra &lt;a href=&quot;https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/dynamo.html&quot;&gt;coordinator node&lt;/a&gt; and is very similar to the “fat client” that Eric Lubow explains in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.slideshare.net/DataStax/optimizing-your-cluster-with-coordinator-nodes-eric-lubow-simplereach-cassandra-summit-2016&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; at Cassandra Summit in 2016. This means when Stargate is deployed, it joins the Cassandra cluster as a coordinator node but does not store any data. We chose this design because coordinator nodes in Cassandra already handle most of the request handling and routing that’s needed for a highly available storage proxy and it made sense to reuse that time-tested logic. This architecture allows for compute to be scaled independently of storage; a common model when using cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high-level architecture diagram below explains where Stargate fits in the stack and the vision for new APIs and integrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/init-stargate/kubernetes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking a closer look, when a request is sent to Stargate, it is handled by the API Service, translated to the database query, and dispatched to the Persistence Service. The Persistence service then sends the request to the storage replicas of that row using Cassandra’s internal QueryHandler. The Persistence Service processes the request and responds to the client once it receives acknowledgements from the number of storage replicas specified by the request consistency level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty classic implementation of “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf&quot;&gt;Dynamo-based&lt;/a&gt;” coordination. Stargate’s ultimate goal is to have pluggable APIs on the front-end and pluggable storage engines on the &lt;em&gt;back-end&lt;/em&gt; with all the Dynamo magic happening in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand how this distributed coordination works a bit more, in a single 6-node datacenter cluster with 3 storage replicas, an incoming request will go to all 3 replicas that own the requested row. In this case, the nodes labeled 1, 3, and 4 are storages nodes that own the data for the request. In the example below, the consistency level is LOCAL_QUORUM which means that Stargate will read or write data to 2 of the 3 storage replicas in order to satisfy the client request and ack the success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/init-stargate/steps.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-started&quot;&gt;Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of the REST API for CRUD operations that serves the data stored in Cassandra tables over HTTP. You can try this example by downloading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.postman.com/downloads/&quot;&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt; and importing the Stargate REST API collection in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/docs/blob/master/modules/developers-guide/examples/stargate-rest-api.postman_collection.json&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Pull down the docker image&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://hub.docker.com/u/stargateio&quot;&gt;https://hub.docker.com/u/stargateio&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;docker pull stargateio/stargate-3_11:v0.0.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Start the docker container&lt;/strong&gt; using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DEVELOPER_MODE=true&lt;/code&gt; env variable. This removes the need to install a separate Cassandra instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;  docker run &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; stargate &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 8081:8081 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 8082:8082 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; 127.0.0.1:9042:9042 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;CLUSTER_NAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;stargate &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;CLUSTER_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;3.11 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DEVELOPER_MODE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;true &lt;/span&gt;stargateio/stargate-3_11:v0.0.3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Generate an auth token&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;  curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-L&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-X&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://localhost:8081/v1/auth'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-H&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--data-raw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'{
    &quot;username&quot;: &quot;cassandra&quot;,
    &quot;password&quot;: &quot;cassandra&quot;
  }'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;authToken&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;{auth-token-here}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Create a keyspace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;  curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--request&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'localhost:8082/schemas/keyspaces'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--data-raw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'{
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;users_keyspace&quot;,
      &quot;replicas&quot;: 1
    }'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;users_keyspace&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5: Create a table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;  curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--request&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'localhost:8082/schemas/keyspaces/users_keyspace/tables'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--data-raw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'{
      &quot;name&quot;: &quot;users&quot;,
      &quot;columnDefinitions&quot;: [
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;firstname&quot;,
          &quot;typeDefinition&quot;: &quot;text&quot;
        },
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;lastname&quot;,
          &quot;typeDefinition&quot;: &quot;text&quot;
        },
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;email&quot;,
          &quot;typeDefinition&quot;: &quot;text&quot;
        },
        {
          &quot;name&quot;: &quot;favorite color&quot;,
          &quot;typeDefinition&quot;: &quot;text&quot;
        }
      ],
      &quot;primaryKey&quot;: {
        &quot;partitionKey&quot;: [&quot;firstname&quot;],
        &quot;clusteringKey&quot;: [&quot;lastname&quot;]
      },
      &quot;tableOptions&quot;: {
        &quot;defaultTimeToLive&quot;: 0,
        &quot;clusteringExpression&quot;:[
          {
            &quot;column&quot;: &quot;lastname&quot;,
            &quot;order&quot;: &quot;ASC&quot;
          }
        ]
      }
    }'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;users&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6: Add rows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;  curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--request&lt;/span&gt; POST &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'localhost:8082/v2/keyspaces/users_keyspace/users'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--data-raw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'{
    &quot;firstname&quot;: &quot;Mookie&quot;,
    &quot;lastname&quot;: &quot;Betts&quot;,
    &quot;email&quot;: &quot;mookie.betts@gmail.com&quot;,
    &quot;favorite color&quot;: &quot;blue&quot;
  }'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;firstname&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Mookie&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;lastname&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Betts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7: Get rows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;  curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-G&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--location&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'http://localhost:8082/v2/keyspaces/users_keyspace/users'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--header&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Content-Type: application/json'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--data-urlencode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'where={&quot;firstname&quot;: {&quot;$eq&quot;: &quot;Mookie&quot;}}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expected Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot; data-lang=&quot;json&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;count&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;data&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;firstname&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Mookie&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;favorite color&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;blue&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;email&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;mookie.betts@gmail.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;&quot;lastname&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Betts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voila! You can find the full reference for the table-based REST API and more in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stargate.io/docs&quot;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-can-i-get-involved&quot;&gt;How can I get involved?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the code and start building with us! We’ve architected this project with exploration, flexibility, and API and storage agnosticism as our &lt;em&gt;first class&lt;/em&gt; citizens; the goal is that this makes it easy for the community to innovate and add new APIs and extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagram below shows how the Stargate modules fit together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/init-stargate/stargate-modules.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get started building a new API extension, have a look at the existing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate/tree/master/restapi&quot;&gt;REST API&lt;/a&gt; implementation in the Stargate repo first. To get started building a new storage extension, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate/tree/master/persistence-cassandra-3.11&quot;&gt;persistence-cassandra-3.11&lt;/a&gt; implementation. Once you have an idea of what you want to build, shoot us a note on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stargate.io/g/stargate-users&quot;&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt; to discuss. Note that the internal APIs are under active development and they are likely to change before the first version is released.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To request new features or file bugs, create a new GitHub issue in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/stargate/stargate&quot;&gt;stargate/stargate&lt;/a&gt; repository and we’ll take it from there.
Let’s Explore
We can’t wait to see where this project takes &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt; and we’ll be rolling out a few new APIs in the coming weeks. You can get updates by following us on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stargateio&quot;&gt;@stargateio&lt;/a&gt; and throw us a star on Github if you like what you see!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re ready for lift-off, see you in the stars! ✨&lt;/p&gt;
